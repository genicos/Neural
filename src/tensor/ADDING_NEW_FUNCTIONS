To add a new tensor function, first add the declarations to functions.h
add the definitions in functions.c
create a new tensor_function struct instance for it in functions.h
add a reference to that struct in tensor_function_table in functions.h
update FUNCTION_CT to reflect the new number of functions

go to src/test/tensor and add tests for the function
